**Challenge Arbitrage Opportunity for Bitcoin**
Specifically, The vice president (VP) of your department is considering arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin trades on markets across the globe, can you capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations in those markets by using the powers of Pandas?

*User Story*:
As a user, I need the ability to compare data from Coinbase and from Bitstamp and find where their are price differences so that I can make profitable trades without sorting manually through spreadsheets.

*Acceptance Criteria*:
Given that Iâ€™m unable to effectively sort through all this data manually on excel, the tool I build should be able to collect, clean, and analyze the data with visuals.


## Usage
The project works by cleaning the data, importing the CSV files, and comparing prices listed by timestamp.
Collected the data via this code:
'''coinbase = pd.read_csv(
    Path("./Resources/coinbase.csv"),
    index_col="Timestamp",
    parse_dates=True,
    infer_datetime_format=True)'''
